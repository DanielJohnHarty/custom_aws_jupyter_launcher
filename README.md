# **Custom AWS Jupyter Launcher**
Python script to launch an EC2 instance, with custom specs and software according to the callers parameters.
Includes a simple mechanism to record the details of what you launch, and they a single command teardown process.

### **Important Remark:**

*The code here is free to use, but it requires that you have an AWS account and that you provide it with the access key and secret key associated with a user on your account. Any activity will be billed to the account associated with that account and user. **Your keys are not visible or shared with any service except AWS.***
